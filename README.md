 This program was written for slove the problem below:
 Devise a fast and practical computation to generate all the shortest unique subsequences of the rice genome
#################################################
 I make a short description below:
 First: I read all the chromosome and combine all the sequence with character “#” and end with “$”.
 I also record each length of the chromosome. Then I construct the   "Ukkonen's Suffix Tree” . 
 Second: To use suffix trees for detecting unique substrings, notice that the path label of any leaf is a unique substring. 
 The set of shortest unique substrings at every position can therefore be discovered by traversing the tree once and looking 
 up the string depth of the parent node of every leaf. This value plus one is the desired length of the shortest unique string that starts at the position indicated by the leaf.If the substring contain character “#” I remove this substring.
 Then I store all these substring in a associative array, key is the position and value is the length of substring.
 Third: I exact all the substrings of each chromosome and find the shortest length of substring, then I print out
all these substring with the shortest length with chromosome name, start position and end position.
 Finally: I could got the shortest substrings of each chromosome.It needed O(N) time to construct the tree also need O(N) to find the substring.

 The prohram was tested under all UNIX-like platform also include Mac OS
 Just complied it by g++ or clang++ (ingored the warnings)
g++ substring.cpp -o substring
 TEST IT 
./substring in.fasta >out.txt
